GROMACS is a well known package for molecular dynamics, 
PLUMED is an open source library for free energy calculations.
More info on : [gromacs site](http://www.gromacs.org/) and [plumed site](http://www.plumed.org/home)
This container contains both sources and parallel binaries.

### There are 2 possible ways to use the container

1. Locally : simply type
```
$ docker run -u gromed -it rinnocente/gromed /bin/bash 
```

2. Locally or remotely via ssh
If you want to use X from the container(gnuplot), or you want to share it with colleagues or you
want to access it directly via the net then you need to start the
container with the ssh-server and map its port on a port on your host.
```
 $ CONT=`docker run -P -d -t rinnocente/gromed`
```
in this way (-P) the std ssh port (=22) is mapped on a free port of the host. We can access the container discovering the port of the host on which the container ssh service is mapped :
```

  $ PORT=`docker port $CONT 22 |sed -e 's#.*:##'`
  $ ssh  -X -p $PORT gromed@127.0.0.1
```
Change the password, that initially is set to *mammamia* , with the **passwd** command.

### Use of vector instruction sets (SIMD)
Different binaries and libraries have been compiled for some of the SIMD instruction sets :
** None SSE2 SSE4.1 AVX_256 AVX2_256 AVX_512 ** 
each in different build subdirs of gromacs-2016.3.
By default the binary and libraries compiled with SSE2, that should be supported by now by everything,
has been installed.
A script can eventually install a more performant version automatically :
```
cd gromacs-2016.3
bash tune-gromacs.sh
```
this script uses sudo and therefore the password is required.
